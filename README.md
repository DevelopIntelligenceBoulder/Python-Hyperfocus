# Python-Hyperfocus

Welcome to the Python Hyperfocus! These notes represent a free 1/2-day course on Python from those who already know how to program in some other language.

Be sure to install Python (www.python.org) and once that's installed you'll want to install Jupyter.

On a Mac you can do

`sudo pip3 install jupyter`

from a Terminal window.

On Windows, do

`pip install jupter`

from a command prompt.

Or install Anaconda, which is a free Python distribution that includes Jupyter and other Data Science tool (www.anaconda.com)
